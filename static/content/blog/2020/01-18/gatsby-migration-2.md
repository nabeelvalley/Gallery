# Gatsbyfication

In order to actually `Gatsbyify` the application, there were still a couple of more things I could do before my _copy and paste_ current page could work at all

1. Create the necessary Gatsby Config files
2. Include the PostCSS Plugin
3. Fix `window` references in 3rd party libraries
